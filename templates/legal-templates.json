DEFINITION OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION\n\n\"Confidential Information\" means any information disclosed by either party (the \"Disclosing Party\") to the other party (the \"Receiving Party\"), either directly or indirectly, in writing, orally or by inspection of tangible objects, which is designated as \"Confidential,\" \"Proprietary\" or some similar designation, or that should reasonably be understood to be confidential given the nature of the information and the circumstances of disclosure. Confidential Information shall include, but not be limited to: {{confidentialInfoTypes}}. \n\nConfidential Information shall not include any information that: (a) was publicly known and made generally available prior to the time of disclosure by the Disclosing Party; (b) becomes publicly known and made generally available after disclosure by the Disclosing Party through no action or inaction of the Receiving Party; (c) is already in the possession of the Receiving Party at the time of disclosure as shown by the Receiving Party's files and records; (d) is obtained by the Receiving Party from a third party without a breach of the third party's obligations of confidentiality; or (e) is independently developed by the Receiving Party without use of or reference to the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information.\n\n## 2. OBLIGATIONS OF RECEIVING PARTY\n\nThe Receiving Party shall: (a) hold the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information in strict confidence; (b) not disclose such Confidential Information to any third parties; (c) use the same degree of care to protect the confidentiality of the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information that it uses to protect its own confidential information, but in no event less than reasonable care; (d) limit access to the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information to those of its employees, agents and representatives who need such access for the Purpose and who have signed confidentiality agreements containing, or are otherwise bound by, confidentiality obligations at least as restrictive as those in this Agreement; and (e) not use any Confidential Information for any purpose outside the scope of the Purpose without the Disclosing Party's prior written permission.\n\n## 3. TERM AND TERMINATION\n\nThis Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and continue for a period of {{term}} years thereafter. The confidentiality obligations set forth in this Agreement shall survive for a period of {{survivalTerm}} years following the expiration or termination of this Agreement.\n\n## 4. RETURN OF MATERIALS\n\nUpon the earlier of (i) the completion or termination of the Purpose, (ii) the termination of this Agreement, or (iii) at any time upon the request of the Disclosing Party, the Receiving Party shall promptly return to the Disclosing Party all copies, whether in written, electronic or other form or media, of the Disclosing Party's Confidential Information, or destroy all such copies and certify in writing to the Disclosing Party that such Confidential Information has been destroyed.\n\n## 5. REMEDIES\n\nThe Receiving Party acknowledges that any breach of its obligations under this Agreement may cause irreparable harm to the Disclosing Party for which monetary damages may not be adequate. Accordingly, the Disclosing Party may seek injunctive or other equitable relief to prevent or stop any breach of this Agreement, in addition to all other remedies available at law or in equity.\n\n## 6. MISCELLANEOUS\n\n6.1 **Governing Law**. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of {{governingLaw}}, without regard to its conflict of laws principles.\n\n6.2 **Entire Agreement**. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements or communications.\n\n6.3 **Amendments**. This Agreement may not be modified except by a written instrument signed by authorized representatives of both parties.\n\n6.4 **Severability**. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect.\n\n6.5 **Assignment**. This Agreement may not be assigned by either party without the prior written consent of the other party.\n\n6.6 **Counterparts**. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement as of the Effective Date.\n\n**{{partyOneName}}**\n\nBy: ________________________\nName: {{partyOneSignatoryName}}\nTitle: {{partyOneSignatoryTitle}}\nDate: ________________________\n\n**{{partyTwoName}}**\n\nBy: ________________________\nName: {{partyTwoSignatoryName}}\nTitle: {{partyTwoSignatoryTitle}}\nDate: ________________________",
