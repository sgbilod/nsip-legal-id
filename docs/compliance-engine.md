# Compliance Engine Documentation

Copyright Â© 2025 Stephen Bilodeau. All rights reserved.

## Overview

The Compliance Engine is a core component of the NSIP Legal IDE extension that provides comprehensive document validation against regulatory requirements. It enables legal professionals to ensure their documents comply with various legal frameworks and jurisdictions.

## Features

- Document validation against multiple regulatory frameworks
- Jurisdiction-specific compliance checks
- Detailed compliance reports with risk areas and recommendations
- Cost estimates for compliance remediation
- Integration with VS Code diagnostic system for inline validation
- Quick fixes for common compliance issues

## Architecture

The ComplianceEngine implements the IService interface and is built around a rule-based system where compliance rules can be registered for specific regulatory frameworks. Each rule can validate a document and return compliance issues.

### Key Components

1. **ComplianceEngine**: Core service that manages rules and performs validation
2. **ComplianceRule**: Interface for implementing specific compliance validation rules
3. **ComplianceIssue**: Represents a specific compliance problem in a document
4. **ComplianceValidationResult**: Contains validation results including issues and recommendations
5. **ComplianceRecommendation**: Suggested actions to resolve compliance issues
6. **ComplianceRiskArea**: Areas of risk identified during validation
7. **CompliancePrediction**: Projected compliance metrics for an organization

## Usage

### Validating a Document

```typescript
// Get the compliance engine from the service registry
const registry = ServiceRegistry.getInstance();
const complianceEngine = registry.get<ComplianceEngine>('complianceEngine');

// Create validation options
const validationOptions = {
    organization: {
        id: 'org-123',
        name: 'My Organization',
        jurisdictions: ['US', 'EU'],
        regulatoryFrameworks: ['GDPR', 'CCPA'],
        // other organization properties
    },
    jurisdictions: ['US', 'EU'],
    frameworks: ['GDPR', 'CCPA'],
    strictMode: false,
    includeRecommendations: true,
    includeRiskAssessment: true
};

// Create or get the legal document
const legalDocument = {
    id: 'doc-123',
    title: 'Privacy Policy',
    content: 'Document content...',
    type: 'agreement',
    // other document properties
};

// Validate the document
const validationResult = complianceEngine.validateDocument(legalDocument, validationOptions);

// Check if document is compliant
console.log(`Document is compliant: ${validationResult.isCompliant}`);
console.log(`Compliance score: ${validationResult.score * 100}%`);

// Get issues
validationResult.issues.forEach(issue => {
    console.log(`${issue.severity}: ${issue.message}`);
});

// Get recommendations
validationResult.recommendations.forEach(recommendation => {
    console.log(`${recommendation.priority}: ${recommendation.title}`);
    console.log(`Description: ${recommendation.description}`);
});
```

### Creating Custom Compliance Rules

You can extend the compliance engine by creating and registering custom rules:

```typescript
// Create a custom rule
const customRule: ComplianceRule = {
    id: 'custom-rule-001',
    name: 'Custom Compliance Rule',
    description: 'Description of what this rule checks',
    framework: 'CUSTOM',
    severity: 'warning',
    validate: (document, options) => {
        const issues: ComplianceIssue[] = [];
        
        // Your validation logic here
        if (!document.content.includes('required text')) {
            issues.push({
                id: 'custom-001-1',
                severity: 'warning',
                message: 'Document is missing required text',
                // other issue properties
            });
        }
        
        return issues;
    }
};

// Register the rule
complianceEngine.registerRule(customRule);
```

## VS Code Integration

The compliance engine integrates with VS Code's diagnostic system to provide inline validation feedback:

```typescript
// Get diagnostics for a document
const diagnostics = complianceEngine.getDiagnostics(legalDocument, validationOptions);

// Set diagnostics in VS Code
const diagnosticCollection = vscode.languages.createDiagnosticCollection('nsip-compliance');
diagnosticCollection.set(documentUri, diagnostics);
```

## Best Practices

1. **Initialize Early**: Initialize the compliance engine early in the extension activation process
2. **Register Rules**: Register all compliance rules during initialization
3. **Cache Results**: Cache validation results when appropriate to improve performance
4. **Use Diagnostics**: Use the diagnostic system for inline feedback during document editing
5. **Provide Quick Fixes**: Implement quick fixes for common compliance issues

## Extending the Engine

The compliance engine is designed to be extensible. You can add support for new regulatory frameworks by:

1. Creating new ComplianceRule implementations
2. Registering the rules with the engine
3. Updating the UI to expose the new frameworks

## Troubleshooting

- **Rule Conflicts**: If multiple rules conflict, the most restrictive rule takes precedence
- **Performance Issues**: Large documents may cause performance issues; consider validating on save rather than continuously
- **False Positives/Negatives**: Rules may produce false results; provide feedback mechanisms for users to report issues
